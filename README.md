# Realistic-Item-Drops
A simple datapack which makes items display nicely on the floor

## Description
This datapack makes items display nicer on the floor. Inspired by the Realistic Item Drops mod, this datapack aims to bring most of the features from the mod to your world without any mods or resource packs.

## Features
- Item dropping that can display realistically, flat or normally
- Quicker pick-up speed
- Little performance issues
- Sprint while throwing to throw further!
- A menu to make it easier for you

## Installation
To install this datapack, go to the latest version through the Releases tab on the right hand side. Then, download RealisticItemDrops.zip. Place this zip file in your world saves folder: `<world save>/datapacks`. Then, open the world and *run /reload*

## Configuration
This datapack comes with a handy menu to change the settings. To show the menu, run the command `/function items:menu`. Then, you can click on the options in the settings to change them.

## Uninstalling
To uninstall the datapack, you can run the command `/function items:uninstall`. This will kill all dropped items and turn off all the features in the datapack. Once you have done this, you can remove the datapack file from the world safely. If you change your mind, just run the command `/function items:reinstall` and all features will be enabled once again
