# Realistic Item Drops

## Description
This datapack makes items display nicer on the floor. Inspired by the [Realistic Item Drops](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/realistic-item-drops) mod, this datapack aims to bring most of the features from the mod to your world without any mods or resource packs.

**Features**
- Item dropping that can display realistically, flat or normally
- Quicker pick-up speed
- Little performance issues
- A menu to make it easier for you

## Enabling and changing settings
Once you install the datapack, run /reload. It will then be ready to play!

If you want to change the display mode, run the command /function items:menu. This will bring up a menu that looks like this:
![Menu](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/723984082853298297/899319000964673566/unknown.png "Realistic Item Drops menu") Here are the display types:
- **[​Realistic]** makes the items display realistically as if you had thrown them.
- **[​Flat]** makes them all display flat on the ground on a 1x1 grid.
- **[​Normally]** makes them display the normal way with no changes.

You can enable and disable despawning, an item takes exactly 5 minutes to despawn. Note that using the kill items options will remove all of the items displayed in the chosen format and you will never be able to get them back again.
